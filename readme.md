> cute markdown editor with preview and copy button for code blocks :3

I was too lazy to copy broken md text from gemini myself, so I made this lol.

## Features

- ðŸ“‹ **Copy buttons for code blocks** - The main reason this exists! Easy code copying with visual feedback
- ðŸŽ¨ **Syntax highlighting** - Beautiful and collapsible code blocks
- ðŸŒ¸ **Real-time preview** - See your markdown rendered instantly as you paste (or write) it
- ðŸŽ¯ **Resizable panes** - Adjust the editor/preview split to your liking

## Usage
